<h1 align="center">Advanced Slides for Obsidian - No Spam Edition</h1>

This is a fork of [Advanced Slides for
Obsidian](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides) that won't spam
pop-ups asking for funding. I do not accept money for this fork, please send
all donations and funding to the original project. I just didn't want to deal
with intrusive pop-ups in my productivity tooling.

<div align="center">
Advanced Slides is the perfect slide deck extension for <a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>
